# ioBroker vis Widget for Asterisk

Widget to enable SIP communication with asterisk.

For implementation fo this widget following code of Doubango Telecom was used: [https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/sipml5](https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/sipml5)

## Preparation
### Install Asterisk
Execute the installation script from ioBroker directory:
```
cd node_modules/iobroker.vis-sip-asterisk/scripts/Asterisk
./install-asterisk.sh  
```

- Enter the IP address of the device   
- Confirm further actions

Install the created CA certificate in the browser you will use asterisk with.

The certificate is valid for 800 days. You can use the `renew-ioBroker-cert.sh` to renew the certificate.

### Activate HTTPS for ioBroker

Execute the ioBroker certificate script from 'scripts/ioBroker':   
```
cd node_modules/iobroker.vis-sip-asterisk/scripts/ioBroker
./init-ioBoker-cert.sh
```

- Enter the IP address of the device   


Install the created CA certificate in the browser you will use ioBroker with.

## Configure the SIP clients
Open the visualization and enter the following data into the popup:

Private Identity: 1060 or 1061   
Public Identity: sip:1060@ipAddress or sip:1061@ipAddress    
Password: password     
Shown name: arbitrary  
Realm: ipAddress   
Websocket Proxy URL: wss://ipAddress:8089/ws

Use the following data for classic SIP clients:

Domain: ipAddress   
Username: 6000 or 6001   
Password: SmartHome!   
Transport: UDP (Port 5060)   

Replace "ipAddress" with the IP address of your asterisk server.

You can define further SIP accounts by editing the asterisk configuration (`pjsip.conf` + `extensions.conf`)

## More Information
In the doc directory you can find a german documentation which describes the configuration and installation process and the use with a `doorbird` door intercom in detail.   
Further information about asterisk can be found on the official asterisk web page: wiki.asterisk.org
